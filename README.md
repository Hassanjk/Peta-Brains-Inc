## AI Combinations
Petabrains, our innovative AI project, aims to seamlessly integrate a diverse range of powerful 
AI tools to create a unified platform. This platform will combine the capabilities of cutting-edge 
models such as GPT-4-32k-0613 (OpenAI), GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI), GPT-4-Turbo-Preview (OpenAI), 
GPT-40 (OpenAI), Chat-GPT-40-Latest, GPT-40-Mini, DALL-E 3 (Azure), GPT-3.5-Turbo (Azure), 
GPT-4 (Azure), ChatGPT-40 (Azure), Gemini 1.0-Pro (Google), Claude-instant-1.2 (Anthropic), 
Claude-2.0 (Anthropic), Ernie-4.0-Turbo (Baidu), Doubao-Pro-128k (ByteDance), Qwen-Turbo (Alibaba), 
Hunyuan-Pro (Tencent), and many others. Although some of these tools currently have limitations on response frequencies, our ultimate goal is to subscribe for unlimited access to these models, allowing us to support up to 10,000 users with uninterrupted, high-quality AI responses.


PetaBrains will expand with the following future milestones:
## Step 1: Revised Token Calculation
Each response is still estimated to use about 500 tokens (including both input and output). So for 10,000 responses, the total tokens processed will be: 10,000responses×500tokens=5,000,000tokens
                                10,000responses×500tokens=5,000,000tokens

## Step 2: Estimated Cost Breakdown for Each AI Tool
Models
  1. OpenAI GPT Models
     -GPT-3.5-Turbo (OpenAI)
     -GPT-4 (8k) (OpenAI)
     -GPT-4 (32k) (OpenAI)
Estimating the cost for 10,000 responses:

  -GPT-3.5-Turbo: 5,000,000 tokens * $0.002/1,000 tokens = $10
  -GPT-4 (8k): 5,000,000 tokens * $0.03/1,000 tokens = $150
  -GPT-4 (32k): 5,000,000 tokens * $0.06/1,000 tokens = $300

  2. Azure OpenAI Models
Azure’s prices are similar to OpenAI's, so we'll use the same rates.

-GPT-3.5-Turbo (Azure): $0.002/1,000 tokens

-ChatGPT-4 (Azure): $0.06/1,000 tokens (32k context)

Estimating the cost for 10,000 responses:
-GPT-3.5-Turbo (Azure): 5,000,000 tokens * $0.002/1,000 tokens = $10
-GPT-4 (Azure): 5,000,000 tokens * $0.03/1,000 tokens = $150
